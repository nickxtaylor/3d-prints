# 3D printing SolidWorks and .stl files

This repo contains files of previously printed parts as well as parts I intend to print in the future or wish to save the .stl file in a handy location. 
Some of these files are CAD files I built myself for personal or academic projects. 
Other files are files I pulled from online resources like printables.com for stuff like gifts. 
Most of the prints I've completed from this repo were printed with a Prusa MK4 printer and associated slicer.
